**Note:** Facebook normally blocks all capital letter names, but these Cherokee Unicode characters bypass that restriction!

## Character Mapping

The tool converts standard English letters to Cherokee Unicode characters:

```
A-Z → Ꭺ Ᏼ Ꮯ Ꭰ Ꭼ Ꮀ Ꮐ Ꮋ Ꮖ Ꭻ Ꮶ Ꮮ Ꮇ Ꮑ Ꮻ Ꮲ Ꮕ Ꭱ Ꮪ Ꭲ Ꮜ Ꮩ Ꮃ Ꮺ Ꭹ Ꮓ
a-z → Ꭺ Ᏼ Ꮯ Ꭰ Ꭼ Ꮀ Ꮐ Ꮋ Ꮖ Ꭻ Ꮶ Ꮮ Ꮇ Ꮑ Ꮻ Ꮲ Ꮕ Ꭱ Ꮪ Ꭲ Ꮜ Ꮩ Ꮃ Ꮺ Ꭹ Ꮓ
```

Other characters (numbers, symbols, spaces) remain unchanged.

## Why Use This Tool?

### 🔥 Facebook Capital Letter Bypass
Facebook has a strict policy against all capital letter names. When you try to write your name in all caps (like "FLAME VORTEX"), Facebook will reject it. But with this tool, you can bypass that restriction!

**How it works:**
- These Cherokee Unicode characters look identical to English capital letters
- Facebook's system doesn't recognize them as "all caps"
- You can successfully use a full capital letter name on Facebook
- Make your profile stand out with a unique stylish name

### ✨ Other Uses
